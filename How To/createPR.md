# Create a PR

Once you've created a new branch and made some changes you then probably want to get your changes into master at some point. There are multiple ways to do this but for now I want to do a PR.

So, you're sitting here at your command prompt. Changes have been made. They've been added. You've commited them you your branch. Let's do a PR!
